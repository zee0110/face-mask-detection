I implemented face mask detection using OpenCV, initializing with NumPy and OpenCV libraries. The project involved loading and reshaping image arrays, creating a labeled dataset, training an SVC model, applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, and assessing model accuracy. Additionally, I implemented live face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers, predicting mask or no mask labels in real-time from webcam feed
